        By Malcolm Beith Nursing a broken foot
        Wayne Rooney limped off the football field just 27 minutes 
        into England's Euro 2004 quarter-final against Portugal.His tournament 
        was over, but what a hard game it had been: Rooney had shot four goals and

         to Bangkok, the golden boy）who would replace Beckham as the new face of 
         football. But the hypedied down as soon as the question of dollars translated into sense. Sure, 
         Rooney is a very good player, declared one commentator, but what could he possibly sell-

        . A player's ability to sell team shirts, shaving cream and everything has become ever
        more crucialto a football club's ability to establish itself as a global brand. At the top of 
        the food chain stands Beckham--the sarong-wearing star whose good looks, 
        family-man image and celebritystatus have helped sell everything from Gillette razors in the
         United States to Meiji Seika
